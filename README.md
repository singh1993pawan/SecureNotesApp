Secure Notes App:
Implement a SQLite database to securely store encrypted notes along with metadata such as timestamps and categories.

Utilize Android Keystore to securely manage the encryption key used for encrypting and decrypting notes stored in the database.

Develop an Android service responsible for periodic backups of encrypted notes to a remote server or cloud storage. The service ensures data safety by securely transferring encrypted data and providing user notifications about backup status.
